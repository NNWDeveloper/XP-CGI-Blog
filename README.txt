It is assumed that you are using Apache HTTPD!
----------------------------------------------------
For the first launch, you need to place the files in the correct folders. Move the files in the htdocs folder to the htdocs folder on the Apache server and the files in the cgi-bin folder to the appropriate folder for CGI files for Apache.

You will also need to enable CGI files on the server. You can do this in the Apache configuration file.
